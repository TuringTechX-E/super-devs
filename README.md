## Overview

i-GOFP (Integrated Government Operations and Financing Platform) is a cloud-based solution tailored to streamline public sector operations and financial management. It is built to help governments across Africa improve efficiency, transparency, and accountability, enhancing their ability to serve citizens. 

Key technologies used:
- **Blockchain**: To ensure secure, tamper-proof tracking of transactions and records.
- **AI & Machine Learning**: For predictive analytics, optimizing resource allocation, and identifying citizen needs.
- **IoT**: For real-time monitoring of public infrastructure (e.g., utilities, roads).
- **Data Analytics**: To provide insights into public sector performance and inform policy decisions.

## System Architecture

i-GOFP follows a microservices architecture, where each feature module operates independently but integrates seamlessly through APIs. The system leverages cloud computing to ensure scalability and resilience.

### High-Level Components:
- **Backend**: Handles the core functionalities of the platform (Node.js, Express)
- **Frontend**: Web-based user interface for government staff and citizens (React, Redux)
- **Blockchain Ledger**: Tracks all public finance transactions securely (Hyperledger)
- **Data Analytics Module**: Manages predictive analytics and AI models (Python, TensorFlow)
- **IoT Data Layer**: Collects and analyzes real-time data from IoT sensors (MQTT, Grafana)
